# AI & ML Internship – Task 4 (Elevate Labs)
## Feature Encoding & Scaling

### 📌 Objective
To understand and apply feature engineering techniques including encoding categorical features and scaling numerical features using the Adult Income Dataset.

### 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

### 🔍 Steps Performed
- Identified categorical and numerical features
- Applied Label Encoding for ordered features
- Applied One-Hot Encoding for nominal features
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler
- Compared dataset before and after scaling
- Saved final preprocessed dataset

### 📁 Deliverables
- Preprocessed dataset (`adult_income_processed.csv`)
- Jupyter Notebook with complete workflow

### 📁 Dataset Note
The processed dataset (`adult_income_processed.csv`) was generated during preprocessing.
Due to GitHub’s file size limit (>25MB), it is not uploaded.
The notebook contains all steps required to regenerate the dataset.

### ✅ Outcome
Gained strong understanding of feature engineering concepts and their impact on machine learning models.
